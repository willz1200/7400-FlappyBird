I used 555 timers, 7400 series logic gates and nothing else to make the "Flappy Bird" video game, its made playable by a green LED matrix representing the wall and standard red LEDs representing the bird. There is also a score counter in the top right which increments when the bird goes through the hole, if the bird crashes into the wall the game will stop.
